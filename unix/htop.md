# htop

htop is an interactive process viewer for Unix systems. It provides a better interface than `top`, has nice shortcuts like `e` (show environment variables set for the process), search process with `/`, etc..

It also presents a menu which is handy because I always forget `top` commands.

## Installation

```bash
brew install htop
```
